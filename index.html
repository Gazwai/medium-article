    <h1>What am I?</h1>
    <p>The lone wolf dies but the pack survives.</p>
    <h1>What am I?</h1>
    <p>I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear.
    I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
    Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.</p>

    <h1>What am I?</h1>
    <p>“See, there were these two guys in a lunatic asylum... and one night, one night they decide they don't like living in an
    asylum any more. They decide they're going to escape! So, like, they get up onto the roof, and there, just across this
    narrow gap, they see the rooftops of the town, stretching away in the moon light... stretching away to freedom. Now, the
    first guy, he jumps right across with no problem. But his friend, his friend didn't dare make the leap. Y'see... Y'see,
    he's afraid of falling. So then, the first guy has an idea... He says 'Hey! I have my flashlight with me! I'll shine it
    across the gap between the buildings. You can walk along the beam and join me!' B-but the second guy just shakes his
    head. He suh-says... He says 'Wh-what do you think I am? Crazy? You'd turn it off when I was half way across!”</p>
